   =============================
   
      - badges are like what we see in notification buttons with numbers. it is given in <span>.
      
      
  ======= Grid System ====================================
  
  - it helps to make custom layout.
  - it requires class="container" 
  - the total size of layout is always 12 unit. you can set your breakpoints accordingly.
  
  - for adding row use class="row".
  - for column class="col-size[in unit]"         total size should be 12 units in   a  single row.
   - class="col" it will do even division of row automatically.
   - if we fix col size the column will never stack when the page is stacked 
      to make it stacked at any breakpoint =>  class: "col-md-4"; so at 4 or grater than 4 it will take 4units and after that it stacked.
      
      we can set it for :  sm, xl ,l ,md
      
      Useful grid utilites.

      justify-content
      align-items : to align items in side div. not div

       Bootstrap & Navbar
      ===================

      navbar : when small screen size :they turn into a stack and hidden.
      
      class="collapse" // to hide div.
