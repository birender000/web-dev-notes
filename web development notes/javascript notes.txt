======================================= javascript ===============================
1.  ECMAScript is other name of javascript.

2. java and javascript both are different
    java is compiled based language whereas javascript is interpreted language.
    
3. javascript is supported by every browser.

4. its a script like we see in movies every element have some line to follow that's why it is known as javascript

5. where we can write javascript without ide.

  chrome developer :- in console we can write code line by line but every time we need to click shift+enter then it will go in next line and run every line one by one
                      there is problem suppose if we don not click shift+ enter  then we will loose our code.
                      
                      other method is  in developer on left corner >> go to snippets -> new snippets
 
 > Javascript is synchronous and single threaded language. every line of code executed one by one and one after another.
 
 HOW JAVA SCRIPT WORK
 ====================
 
 > there is a term called Execution context. which is created when code go for interpretions.
 > it comprises of two things 
        a> memory creation
        b> code execution
 > in memory creation phase variables and functions got memory.
 > in code execution phase lines of codes or threads are executed one by one.
 
 > if there are multiple functions in code or function inside function [like reccursion]
 then an call stack is created with execution context at the end and will pop at the end of execution of code.
 
 HOISTING IN JAVASCRIPT
 ======================
 > it is phenomenon by which we can access variable or function without any problem or error.
 > when the memory is allocated to variable then it is assigned as undefined but if there is no variable declared then it is called not defined.
